# Pok√©SAG
A web interface for viewing SDR-captured POCSAG pages

## Dependencies
* LuaRadio
  * Dependencies of LuaRadio (fftw3, libvolk, libliquid)
* LuaJIT
* sqlite3
* lsqlite3 for Lua (`luarocks install lsqlite3 --local`)
* sqlite3 for Node (`npm install` in the WebApp directory)

### For Postgres
* libpg-dev
* Postgres for Lua (`luarocks install luapgsql --local PQ_INCDIR=/usr/include/postgresql PQ_LIBDIR=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf`)
  * Note: This command will need to be modified if not running on ARM
* Postgres for Node (`npm install` in the WebApp directory)

## Configuration
* The port for the web app can be supplied as the environment variable PORT. (defaults to 8080)
* Edit `run.sh` to choose between 'pokesag.lua' (SQLite3 single-file database) and 'pokesag-postgres.lua' (Postgres database)
* Frequency and device configuration is done by manually editing the source file `pokesag.lua` / `pokesag-postgres.lua`.
  * This has been pre-populated with some frequencies used in New Zealand.

## Running
* Launch the receiver with the `./run.sh` script. This will receive pages and store them in a database.

* Launch the WebApp with NodeJS: `nodejs WebApp.js`. This will show the latest 100 pages on localhost:8080.
  * Use `WebApp-postgres.js` if using Postgres instead of SQLite3
